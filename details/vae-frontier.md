> Deep learning involving, e.g., variational autoencoders have been shown to be useful. The learned latent space in the variational autoencoders has been employed to generate unsampled protein conformations, and simulations starting from these conformations accelerated the sampling.

> A disadvantage of using traditional autoencoders is that the information is not efficiently and continuously mapped to the latent space which prohibits effective sampling.

> Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been successfully employed to explore the conformational space and allosteric transitions in adenosine kinase (Figure 2), showing that the learned latent space can be used to generate unsampled protein conformations and initiate additional MD simulations to sample a transition from the closed to the open states and explored hidden allosteric states.

> Beyond the accuracy of the energy function, generative AI/ML models can also expedite sampling speed [52,34]. This capability is also based on the active learning process, in which a small number of MD snapshots is used to train a generative model for acquiring additional MD snapshots. This learned generation model helps explore a wider conformational space and improve sampling efficiency.

>  The results show that VAEs[2] outperform traditional autoencoders in identifying good CVs and representing the complex high-dimensional input in a lower- dimensional encoded representation. The study also highlights the importance of selecting efficient feature-engineered input, as machine learning models are sensitive to it.

> For example, a number of DL-based, approaches have already been proposed, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), which significantly increases sampling “power”, if combined with MD potential. Tian et al. (2021) demonstrated successful protein sampling with VAEs on the example of adenosine kinase (ADK) conformational change from its closed state to the open one. Decoded conformations were similar to the training ones. Additionally, the latent space provided by VAEs could serve as a starting point for new simulations and studying of unexplored conformational spaces. VAEs application allows to perform short simulations of 20 ns and reach sampling efficiency comparable to a single long MD simulation.
