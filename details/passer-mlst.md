> Protein Allosteric Sites Server (PASSer), developed by the Tao Lab, is an ensemble machine learning method21 [combining eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)] to predict allosteric sites for a given structure. It can learn both physical properties and topology. Specifically, it used fpocket to detect possible pockets. For each pocket, physical properties are calculated and integrated using a pretrained XGBoost model, and an atomic graph is constructed and fed into a pretrained GCNN model. The strength of this method is its leverage of powerful machine learning methods to optimally exploit multiple features and topology information, although its power may be limited by the use of a single conformation. It is available as a web server at https://passer.smu.edu.

> NSP10 potential binding pocket was also validated by Protein Allosteric Sites Server (PASSer) (https://passer.smu.edu/). Based on FPocket algorithm and ensemble learning method, the allosteric pockets were also identified and detected [26]. These allosteric pockets were calculated as average probability of eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) models. The top ranked NSP10 pocket was considered as potential binding site.

> A pocket very similar to that identified by PASSer was previously identified in a cocrystal structure of PAI-1 bound to a small-molecule inhibitor that binds reversibly and allosterically inhibits interactions with both proteases and vitronectin.

> Comparison of the drug-bound crystal structure and the PASSer pocket reveals that while most of the same residues are involved in both the experimental drug-binding pocket and our proposed allosteric pocket, the side-chain arrangements are not identical.
