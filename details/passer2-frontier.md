> We determined that AutoGluon was the superior framework, and therefore it was used as the classifier. AutoGluon contains 26 base models including random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network, and in our experiments, we used all the base models for training the model [51].

> AI might also be able to address this challenge, as it can be used not only to identify new putative TFs, but also to predict the pockets (i.e., sites) of allosteric interaction (Figure 2A) with the ligand in the LBD (Panjkovich and Daura, 2014; Greener and Sternberg, 2015; Xiao et al., 2021).
